# JobTracker

Objectives
The functionality of the web app would include:
>>Account creation (user auth)
>>Users can create jobs/internships
>>Users can also create 'skills' which can relate to specific jobs/internships: Allows them to track
which jobs require which skills, see how frequently certain skills are noted within applications, and
track how comfortable they are with those skills/if they need to work on those skills more (ex: 'Docker
is noted in 60% of your applications').
>>Users can create 'contacts': keep track of networking, contact information for individuals they've
networked with who may be related to specific jobs/companies they're applying to.
